# Ecommerce-web-app
React+MySql+Express+Node

Clome the repository open in terminal the folder where you have clone this repository

cd app

npm install

cd ecomfront

npm install

npm start



Open another terminal and in the app folder and do
nodeomn

All set to see the app
Here I am assuming you have setup the config file in the config folder of app for your own mySql setup

There are same apis which are available by backend but not using in frontapp
like user/create--user etc..
Just check the route file for each folder (except the ecomfront) in the main folder, you will get there.
